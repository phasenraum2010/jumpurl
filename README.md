# TYPO3 Extension "jumpurl"

Adds functionality to configure and handle short links in the TYPO3 Frontend.

The functionality was part of TYPO3, until TYPO3 CMS 7 LTS, and moved into its own
extension, receiving its own public repository.

## Installation
The latest version can be installed via TER (http://typo3.org) or via composer
by adding ''composer require friendsoftypo3/jumpurl'' in a TYPO3 CMS 7+ installation.

## Current state
The latest version here reflects a feature-complete state.

## Contribution
Feel free to submit any pull request, or add documentation, tests, as you please.
We will publish a new version every once in a while, depending on the amount of changes
and pull requests submitted.

### License
The extension is published under GPL v2+, all included third-party libraries are
published under their respective licenses.

### Authors
Initially developed by Kasper Skaarhoj, it was polished by over 100 contributors in this
area while being part of the TYPO3 Core, and then extracted into its own extension by
Alexander Stehlik and Benni Mack.

This package is now maintained by a loose group of TYPO3 enthusiasts inside
the TYPO3 Community. Feel free to contact Benni Mack (benni.mack@typo3.org) for any questions
regarding "jumpurl".
